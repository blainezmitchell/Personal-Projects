This project is designed to expand upon a program I created in Data Structures. The original program took
a string of letters and output every possible combination of words you could make with those letters,
given a dictionary that was stored in a txt file. The goal was to turn this into a real-time game. In
order to do this, I needed to convert my original program from C++ into Java, and then set up a server
and client for the game. The game needed to be able to be played with any number of players and keep
track of their scores and guesses.

I chose this project because I loved the idea of using networking concepts to create a fun, real-time
game. I wasn't sure what kind of game I wanted to make, as I wanted it to be simple enough that I could
feasibly implement it as a first project but also complicated enough to be challenging and force me to use
new tools. I ultimately settled on this as it took something I created before and expanded on it, which made
it feel more personal and also more fun to work on, as it was all original material.

In terms of technical challenges, this was quite the challenge for me personally. At the start of the project, I
wasn't particularly well-versed in the networking side of Java nor with Android Studio, and so a lot of the
programming took longer than it probably otherwise would have. However, as a result of my trials, I feel much
more confident utilizing these tools in the future, and I'm also quite proud of the final product. I plan
on expanding on this project even more at some point in the future, to add more features and smooth out
some of the existing parts.
